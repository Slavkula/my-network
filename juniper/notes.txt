1. Configuring interface addresses:
https://github.com/Slavkula/my-network/blob/main/juniper/playbooks/interfaces.yml
In this playbook I'll use "when: N is defined" for configuring interfaces which defined in my inventory file.
I don't use checking whether the interface already has an address or not.
